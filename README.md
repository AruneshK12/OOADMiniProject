# OOADMiniProject

## Problem Statement - Team 9

The suggested project is a fully automated Business Process Outsourcing System (BPOS)
which outsources a client company’s extra work load to various service providers for the best use of
their resources.

## Domain of the Project

Business Process Outsourcing Management System

## Existing System

Business process outsourcing (BPO) is the practice in which a company hires other
companies, usually called as service providers, to perform tasks for client companies. This is
usually done as a company might not need or have the facilities provided by an in-house
service provider. The advantages of outsourcing is it increases the company’s productivity by
streamlining their resources towards their core processes, reducing labor costs and getting
expert solutions on non-core domains.


## Gaps in the Existing System

Although BPO seems beneficial at first, it does come at a risk, mainly in the form of breach of data, relationship challenges, extra time spent, etc..

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to create a fully automated Business Process Outsourcing
System (BPOS). This system enables various businesses to find the required service providers
with ease. The service providers mention their rate as well as the resources they are ready to
offer. The companies which want to outsource can search through the available list of service
providers that are filtered based on the company’s requirements. Once a suitable service
provider is selected, the company moves towards contacting and finalizing the budget and
employing their services.

### How it Works and Why it is important

The BPOS takes care of the hassle of looking at various service providers and screening
them to find the correct fit. Here, the company’s requirements and current resources are taken
and service providers are presented and the filtering is done by the software.

### Financial Cost

The overall cost comprises Resource cost, Infrastructure cost and Operational cost.

### Stakeholders

The stakeholders are the project leaders, companies which want to outsource their
processes, companies which provide services, the developers who would be constantly
updating and fixing the bugs in the system and investors.

### Manpower required for the system development

The manpower required are software engineers to code the software aspect of the fully
automated BPO system, project leads and management, a Human Resources team for company
and employee welfare, a Public Relations team to touch base with the stakeholders.

## Benefits of the Solution

The proposed solution provides a curated list of service providers which satisfy the
business requirements provided by the client while offering security benefits for all the parties
involved.

## Summary

In current times, BPO is an important important practice in any organization. But
BPO’s can be time consuming, possibility of breach of data and relationship challenges can
hinder the outsourcing process. Hence a solution to create a BPO management system that
finds the optimum service providers for an organization based on the outsourcing
requirements. This solution is helpful for all project leaders as it reduces the time required in
searching for the service providers and helps the service providers get offers which are a fit for
them. This solution also provides security for all the parties involved in the BPO process.
